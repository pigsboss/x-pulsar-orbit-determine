#summary Two-body system dynamics specification.

= Introduction =

This page specifies the dynamics of a two-body system.


= Details =

The simulated two-body system features:
  * A central planet (or, very close to the barycenter).
  * A satellite orbiting the central planet.
  * Gravity driven process.
  * Model error due to mass and gravitational constant uncertainty, et al.
